## Software Setup

### 1. MicroPython Installation

1. Install MicroPython on your Pico W
2. Upload the following files to your Pico:
   - `alarm.py` - Main alarm clock system
   - `bluetooth_alarm_manager.py` - Bluetooth BLE manager
   - `DS3231.py` - RTC driver

### 2. Required Libraries

The Pico W needs:

- `picozero` - For LED control (usually pre-installed)
- `bluetooth` - Built-in BLE support
- `machine`, `time`, `json` - Standard MicroPython libraries

### 3. Time Configuration

Before first use, set the current time by uncommenting and running this line in `alarm.py`:

```python
rtc.set_time(2025, 1, 15, 14, 30, 0)  # YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS
```

## Bluetooth Testing

### Method 1: Python Test Client (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites

Install the required Python package on your computer:

```bash
pip install bleak
```

#### Running Tests

1. **Start the Pico W alarm clock**:

   ```python
   # On the Pico W (via Thonny or similar)
   exec(open('alarm.py').read())
   ```

2. **Run the test client on your computer**:

   ```bash
   python test_bluetooth_client.py
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive menu** to test various functions:
   - Ping device
   - List alarms
   - Add/remove/toggle alarms
   - Check system status

#### Automated Testing

Choose option 2 in the test client for automated tests that will:

- Connect to the device
- Test all major functions
- Add/modify/remove test alarms
- Verify responses

### Method 2: Mobile App Testing

#### Android (using nRF Connect)

1. **Install nRF Connect** from Google Play Store
2. **Scan for devices** - look for "PicoAlarmClock"
3. **Connect to device**
4. **Find the Alarm Service** (`12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc`)
5. **Use characteristics**:
   - **Command** (`...abd`): Write JSON commands
   - **Response** (`...abe`): Read responses and enable notifications
   - **Status** (`...abf`): Read current status

#### iOS (using LightBlue Explorer)

1. **Install LightBlue Explorer** from App Store
2. **Scan and connect** to "PicoAlarmClock"
3. **Navigate to services** and find the Alarm Service
4. **Write commands** to the Command characteristic
5. **Enable notifications** on Response characteristic

## Command Protocol

All commands are JSON-formatted strings sent to the Command characteristic.

### Basic Commands

#### Ping Device

```json
{ "type": "ping" }
```

#### Get Status

```json
{ "type": "status" }
```

#### List All Alarms

```json
{ "type": "list" }
```

### Alarm Management

#### Add Alarm

```json
{
  "type": "add",
  "hour": 7,
  "minute": 30,
  "name": "Morning Alarm",
  "days": null,
  "recurring": true
}
```

**Parameters:**

- `hour`: 0-23 (required)
- `minute`: 0-59 (required)
- `name`: Alarm identifier (optional)
- `days`:
  - `null` for daily alarms
  - `[0,1,2,3,4]` for weekdays (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
  - `[5,6]` for weekends
- `recurring`: `true` for repeating, `false` for one-time

#### Remove Alarm

```json
{
  "type": "remove",
  "alarm": "Morning Alarm"
}
```

_Use alarm name or index number_

#### Toggle Alarm

```json
{
  "type": "toggle",
  "alarm": 0
}
```

_Enable/disable alarm by name or index_

### Example Alarm Scenarios

#### Daily Wake-up Alarm

```json
{
  "type": "add",
  "hour": 7,
  "minute": 0,
  "name": "Daily Wake-up",
  "days": null,
  "recurring": true
}
```

#### Weekday Work Alarm

```json
{
  "type": "add",
  "hour": 6,
  "minute": 30,
  "name": "Work Alarm",
  "days": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  "recurring": true
}
```

#### One-time Reminder

```json
{
  "type": "add",
  "hour": 15,
  "minute": 30,
  "name": "Doctor Appointment",
  "recurring": false
}
```

## Response Format

All responses are JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "response_type",
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "time": 1640995200,
  "data": {
    /* Additional response data */
  }
}
```

### Response Types

- `welcome` - Connection established
- `add_success` - Alarm added successfully
- `remove_success` - Alarm removed
- `toggle_success` - Alarm toggled
- `list_success` - Alarm list (includes `alarms` array)
- `status_success` - System status
- `pong` - Response to ping
- `heartbeat` - Periodic status update
- `error` - Error occurred

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Can't find "PicoAlarmClock" device

- Ensure Pico W is running and Bluetooth is initialized
- Check for error messages in Pico console
- Try resetting the Pico W
- Make sure you're within Bluetooth range (< 10 meters)

**Problem**: Connection drops frequently

- Check power supply to Pico W
- Ensure stable Wi-Fi environment
- Monitor error count in status responses

### Command Issues

**Problem**: Commands not working

- Verify JSON format is correct
- Check characteristic UUIDs match
- Ensure you're writing to Command characteristic
- Enable notifications on Response characteristic

**Problem**: "Invalid JSON" errors

- Use proper JSON formatting (double quotes)
- Escape special characters
- Test JSON validity online

### Time Issues

**Problem**: Alarms not triggering at correct time

- Verify RTC time is set correctly
- Check timezone settings
- Ensure DS3231 battery is good

## Development and Customization

### Extending Commands

To add new commands:

1. **Add command handler** in `bluetooth_alarm_manager.py`:

   ```python
   elif cmd_type == 'MYCOMMAND':
       self._handle_my_command(command)
   ```

2. **Implement handler method**:
   ```python
   def _handle_my_command(self, command):
       # Your command logic here
       self._send_response({"type": "success", "message": "Done"})
   ```

### Customizing UUIDs

Update these constants in both files if needed:

```python
_ALARM_SERVICE_UUID = bluetooth.UUID("your-service-uuid")
_COMMAND_CHAR_UUID = bluetooth.UUID("your-command-uuid")
# etc.
```

### Error Recovery

The system includes several resilience features:

- **Command Queue**: Commands are queued and retried on failure
- **Connection Health**: Automatic timeout detection and recovery
- **Error Counting**: System recovery after too many errors
- **Memory Management**: Periodic garbage collection
